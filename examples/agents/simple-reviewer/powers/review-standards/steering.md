# Review Standards

## Code Review Guidelines

### Structure and Organization
- Check for logical code organization
- Ensure functions and classes have single responsibilities
- Look for appropriate separation of concerns
- Verify consistent file and directory structure

### Naming and Clarity
- Variable and function names should be descriptive
- Avoid abbreviations unless they're well-known
- Use consistent naming conventions throughout
- Check for meaningful comments where needed

### Error Handling
- Ensure appropriate error handling is present
- Check for proper exception handling
- Verify edge cases are considered
- Look for potential null/undefined issues

### Documentation
- Check that public APIs are documented
- Ensure README files are up-to-date
- Verify code comments explain "why" not just "what"
- Look for missing or outdated documentation
